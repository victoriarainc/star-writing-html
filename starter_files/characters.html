      Star has two main motivations:

      Learning to control her wand
      Keeping the wand out of the wrong hands
    </p>

      Marco is Star's best friend. He is kind, responsible, very organized, and supportive of others. He has a reputation at his school for being the "safe kid" due to avoiding danger and being cautious, though he insists that he is a "misunderstood bad boy".
